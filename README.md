# time_for_monkey_to_type_hamlet
When a friend told me how long it would take for a monkey to type hamlet I made this program to test it. I however failed to realize quite how long I would need to run for my program to exit. As we have 26 characeters possible the chance for each one being correct is 1/26. The chance to randomly type hamelt would then be (1/26)^ 150012 which is around  1.0426 * 10^-212263. Then X = (1-(1/26)^ 150012)^n were X is the chance of not generating hamlet and n is the number of times we run the program. To achieve a 50% percent chance of generating hamlet we need to run the program around 6.648 * 10 ^212262. Therefore, I decided that it might not be possible to simulate as easily as I thought.
